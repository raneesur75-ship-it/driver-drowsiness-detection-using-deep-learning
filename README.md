## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

Drowsy driving is a major cause of road accidents worldwide.  
This system detects early signs of fatigue and alerts the driver in real-time — a lightweight, low-cost, deployable safety solution.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Webcam-based monitoring with MediaPipe Face Mesh (468 landmarks)  
- **Dual Analysis**: Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) + Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) + CNN classification  
- **AI-Powered**: MobileNetV2 CNN with **96.5%** test accuracy  
- **Smart Augmentation**: Stable Diffusion for synthetic training data  
- **Professional UI**: Live fatigue score (0–100%), real-time graphs, status indicators  
- **Multi-trigger Alarm**: Sound alerts for eye closure, yawning, head nodding

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Class       | Accuracy | Notes                     |
|-------------|----------|---------------------------|
| Closed_Eyes | ~99%     | Almost perfect detection  |
| Open_Eyes   | ~99%     | Clear pattern recognition |
| No_Yawn     | ~95%     | Good distinction          |
| Yawn        | 95.8%    | High recall for safety    |

**Overall Test Accuracy: 96.50%** on 572 test images

## 📚 Dataset

- **Total images**: 2,845  
- **Split**: 80% training + 20% testing (572 test images)  
- **4 Classes**: Closed_Eyes, Open_Eyes, No_Yawn, Yawn (balanced)

**Sources**:
- Public Kaggle datasets  
- Self-collected photos/videos from online sources  
- Augmented with OpenCV + Stable Diffusion (synthetic images)

Full dataset is large, so not on GitHub. Sample images are in `data/sample/`.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
Webcam → Face Mesh → EAR/MAR → CNN → Fatigue Score → Alarm
```
The system uses a hybrid approach (fast rule-based + deep learning) for reliable real-time drowsiness detection.

### 💡 Why This Works

Lightweight → runs on laptop

Hybrid approach → reduces false alarms

Real-time processing → practical deployment

## 🚀 Key Innovations
